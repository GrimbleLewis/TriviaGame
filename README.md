# TriviaGame

This game goes through 8 different questions and keeps track of if you got the answers right or wrong. 

This activity uses timers to add a layer of urgency to the user so if they can't decide in time they get the question wrong and the game goes on the the next question.

This is a futurama themed trivia game and gives you the option to play a song alongside of taking the quiz.
